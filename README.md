# NumberSense Tutor

NumberSense Tutor is an interactive web app that helps students strengthen their understanding of number sense, addition, subtraction, and number decomposition.  
It was designed for learners who need extra practice visualizing quantities, building mental math strategies, and developing confidence with basic arithmetic.

Live App:  
https://edgarhd1.github.io/NumberSenseTutor/

## Purpose

This app is built especially for students who:
- Struggle with number representation (understanding what quantities “look like”).
- Have difficulty breaking numbers into parts (e.g., knowing that 15 is 10 and 5).
- Need more time to build automatic recall of simple math facts.

It supports these students through visual models, practice modes, and immediate feedback — all in a low-stress, game-like format.

## Features

- Flash Card Mode: Quick recall of addition and subtraction facts.  
- Visual Mode: Ten-frame and dot representations to strengthen quantity visualization.  
- Word Problem Mode: Real-world story problems to improve comprehension.  
- Decomposition Mode: Practice breaking numbers into pairs that make a total (e.g., 8 = 3 + 5).  
- Hints: Optional step-by-step clues to build strategy, not just memorization.  
- Progress Tracking: Displays number of correct answers, attempts, streak, and average time.

## Controls

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|-----------|
| Check your answer | Enter |
| Get a new problem | N |
| Show a hint | H |

You can also click the on-screen buttons to perform the same actions.

## How to Use

1. Choose a mode (Flash, Visual, Word, or Decompose).  
2. Select Addition, Subtraction, or Mixed problems.  
3. Adjust the maximum number to fit the learner’s comfort level.  
4. Type answers and press Enter to check.  
5. Use New Problem to move to the next one.

## Hosting

The app is built entirely with:
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

It’s hosted on GitHub Pages, so it can be accessed directly from any web browser—no installation or login required.

## Local Setup (for developers or teachers)

If you want to modify or test locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edgarhd1/NumberSenseTutor.git
cd NumberSenseTutor
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser, or use VS Code’s Live Server extension.

## Future Enhancements

- Add timed practice sessions for fluency tracking.  
- Add audio feedback (correct / incorrect tones).  
- Create teacher mode for saving student progress.  
- Add multiplication/division extensions.

## Teacher Usage Guide

The NumberSense Tutor can be used in small groups, one-on-one tutoring, or independent practice sessions.  

**Suggested classroom uses:**
- Integrate it into a daily math warm-up (5–10 minutes).  
- Assign specific modes based on student needs (e.g., Visual Mode for early learners, Decompose Mode for developing number flexibility).  
- Use the on-screen progress tracker to monitor speed and accuracy improvements over time.  
- Pair students with peers to explain how they solved problems to reinforce verbal reasoning.  
- Encourage students to verbalize decompositions (e.g., “15 is 10 and 5”) to strengthen conceptual understanding.  
- For struggling learners, start with small number ranges (5–10) and gradually increase difficulty.

**Goal:**  
To help students internalize number relationships, develop mental math fluency, and build confidence in foundational operations.
